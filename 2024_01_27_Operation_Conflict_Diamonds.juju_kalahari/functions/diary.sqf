This location doubles as a training base for the local military, making it a central hub for the PMC's operations.

The strategic importance of targeting the airport is twofold. Firstly, the operation aims to cripple the enemy's operational capabilities by disrupting their centralized command and control structure. Secondly, it seeks to weaken the overall command structure of the PMC, undermining their ability to exert influence and control in the region. In essence, hitting the airport is a calculated move to further secure the region, ensuring a significant setback for the PMC's presence and operations in the Central African Republic.

In exchange for providing security services and training to the local police and military the PMCs have solidified their position by establishing mining operations. Operation Conflict Diamonds is authorized to address this situation, focusing on Bimbi village and its nearby airport to dismantle the mercenaries' operations.
